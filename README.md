To work with Neon CRM API: https://developer.neoncrm.com/api/


THIS GEM IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED and may have severe issues.  As of this writing,
this gem only handles reading information from the API and so should not be able
to affect the data stored on Neon's servers.

You are welcome to contribute to this code base.  The LGPL license is just to prevent it
